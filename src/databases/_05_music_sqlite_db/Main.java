/*
 * The Music SQLite Database
 *
 * Let's now switch to using music db so that we can have a decent set of data to work with as we look into more details at performing
 *  queries
 *
 * Download the same database music.zip again, unzip it and add it to this project
 *
 * Open the database from the DB Browser for SQLite and we can now see the 3 tables from the music db: artists , albums and songs
 * And we can browse the data as well for all the tables and now we have a good representation of the data
 *
 * Let's now pay more attention to how we structure our code, especially since we'd want to work with the music db with a GUI type
 *  application
 * We'll start by connecting to the database and use String CONSTANTS from the beginning
 *
 * Create a package known as model
 *
 *  - Create Datasource class
 *
 * ////////////////
 * Test Connection
 * ////////////////
 *
 * Create an instance of the Datasource class
 *
 *      Datasource datasource = new Datasource();
 *
 *  - Call open() from the Datasource instance
 *      - Check if the result is false, and print to the user that the connection to the database failed
 *      - If this is the case, check if the sqlite jdbc driver is added to the project and rerun again
 *      - If no errors, then the connection is working fine
 *
 *
 * ////////////////////////////
 * First Query - Artists Table
 *
 * We'll select all the rows in the table and print them to the console
 * We'll add a method to the Datasource class to do this
 * In large enterprise applications, we may need to create a Class in the model package for each table and the connections might be coming
 *  from a connection pool
 * But for this application, we'll keep our database methods within the Datasource class
 * In this scenario, do we want the method to return a ResultSet ?
 *  - We'll no we don't, because we don't want classes that use methods in the model package to have to understand the implementation details
 *     of the model
 *  - That way if we change databases later, or change to something that isn't a database, an xml file for example, we only have to change the
 *     code in the model package
 *  - So, instead of returning a ResultSet, we can return a List<Artist>
 *
 * That means we'll need classes for the Artist, Album and the Song , and we'll create those in the model package
 *
 * So let's go ahead and create those classes plus the Getter and Setter methods
 *
 *
 * ////////////////////////////////
 * Artist , Album and Song classes
 * ////////////////////////////////

 * Artist : class
 *      id : int
 *      name : String

         *
         * //// RESULTS /////
         * - We got an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error, which means that under the hood, the JDBC API, uses zero-based
         *  index, and works with some sort of an array-like structure
         *
         * - However, both the artist and the albums were added, but the question is WHY ?
         * - Didn't we have some code in there to do rollback ?
         *
         * //// EXPLANATION ////
         * - SQLException wasn't thrown, but rather the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException was thrown
         * - Therefore , the catch block was bypassed and rollback wasn't executed
         * - The finally block was executed which had the side effect of committing the changes and that's why the
         *   artist and the album were both saved
         *
         * ////  SOLUTION /////
         * - So, how do we actually get around this ?
         * - What we should do here is that instead of catching a SQLException, we should really catch all exceptions
         * - So let's change the SQLException to Exception and that will catch array index out of bounds exception or
         *   a SQLException , or any other Exception for that matter and we should get a rollback
         *
         * // TESTING ///
         * - Delete both entries from artists and albums table :-
         *      - artist : Everly Brothers
         *      - album : All-Time Greatest Hits
         * - Rerun again and check whether we get the proper behaviour that we're looking for which is a proper
         *   rollback
         *
         * ///// RESULTS ///
         * - This time, we get the correct behavior
         *      - Insert Song Exception
         *      - We get Performing Rollback
         *      - And Resetting commit behavior
         * - We'll still doing auto-commit to true, but the rollback() was called prior to that, and we should find
         *   that changes weren't added to the database this time
         *
         * - And this time the artist, album or the song were neither added
         *
         *
         * ///// FIX THE ERROR ////
         * - Re-run to make sure things are still working as they should
         * - Change the index back from 7 to 3
