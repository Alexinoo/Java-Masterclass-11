        /* NOT OPERATOR
         * One version of NOT is using ^ inside the []
         * [^abc]
         * - means not when it's the first character within square braces
         * - this regex matches all characters except a, b and c
         *
         * Another version of NOT OPERATOR is the exclamation mark character
         * - Has to be used in a negative look ahead expression
         *
         * Example
         * - Find t's that aren't followed by v
         *
         * - Shows on 2 occurrences but we have 3
         * - The last is not followed by other character and therefore no other character to match with
         * - [^v] means we have to match t with another character, but not v
         * - the last t is not matched to anything - consumes a character, requires a character to be there
         *
         *
         *
         * - Instead of using [^v] , we can use the NOT operator which is the ! in a negative look ahead expression
         * - A look ahead doesn't consume characters, it can actually match nothing
         * - So let's change ou regex "t[^v]" to "t(?!v)"
         *      - We want t that isn't followed by a v
         *      - The ? inside the parentheses is part of the look ahead syntax
         *          - And look ahead always start with (?
         *      - The ! doesn't consume a character, so it will match instances of T at the end of the string
         *
         *
         * Positive look ahead
         * - Suppose we wanted only matches of t's that are followed by v
         * - In this case we use positive look ahead : "t(?=v)"

         * Look at a couple of examples
         * Regex are usually used to validate user input
         *
         * Validate US phone number : (800) 123-4567
         * Regex: ^([\\(]{1}[0-9]{3}[\\)]{1}[ ]{1}[0-9]{3}[\\-]{1}[0-9]{4})$
         *
         * -- Explanation --
         * - Start by indicating that the line has to start with the entire pattern
         *      - If anything occurs before this pattern in the String, then it's not a phone no
         * - We expect area code to be within parentheses
         *      - The first character we expect is the open parentheses
         *      - We have to escape it, as we have seen, the parentheses is a character class used to indicate a group
         *      - But in this case we want to match the parentheses character literal
         *      - And when we want to match a character literal, that can also be used as a character class in a regex, we have to escape it this way
         *
