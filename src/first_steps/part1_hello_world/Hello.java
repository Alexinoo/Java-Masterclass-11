/*
 * Hello World Project
 * ...................
 * - Java programs (and most other programming languages) have keywords
 * - Each has a specific meaning and sometimes they need to be used in specific orders
 *
 * - You write Java programs by following a specific set of rules, using a combination of these keywords and other
 *   things you'll see which will collectively form a Java program
 *
 * N/B
 * - Keywords are case-sensitive
 *    - public and Public and even PUBLIC are different things
 *
 * - Below
 *    - public and class are two java keywords
 *    - they have a specific meaning which we'll find out more later in the course
 *
 * - Also notes that intelliJ highlights or bolds them
 *
 * public
 *  - This is a Java keyword that is known as an access modifier
 *  - An access modifier allows us to define the scope or how other parts of your code or even someone else's code can
 *    access this code
 *  - We use the public access modifier to give full access
 *
 * class
 *  - The class keyword is used to define a class with the name following the keyword
 *  - "Hello" in this case
 *
 * {}
 *  - the left and right curly braces defines the class block
 *
 * Summary
 * .......
 *  - To define a class, it requires an optional access modifier, followed by class, then the class name , with opening left
 *    and right curly braces
 *  - The left and right curly braces defines the class body
 *    - anything between them is "part" of this class
 *  - we can have data and code inside the class body
 *
 *  - so that's our first project and our first class defined
 *
