/*
 *  Comparable and Comparator
 *
 * - The collections framework includes classes that sorts their elements
 * - To really understand all this we need to understand how that works in order to create our own classes that we can use or we could store in
 *   sorted collections
 * - We implemented the Comparable interface, so that we could experiment with the Collections.sort() and Collections.reverse()
 *      - We've seen how easy it is to create the 1 required method of the interface, which of course was the compareTo()
 *
 * - We'll continue using the Theater example because the Seats give us a reasonably sized data set to play with
 *      - And also because it's regenerated for us by the Theater's class constructor
 *
 * - Use Theater class and make changes to the fields
 *      - Change List<Seat> to private
 *
 *      - Change Seat class
 *          - add a price field
 *          - initialize it in the Constructor
 *
 *      - use the direct Collections.binarySearch() approach
 *
 *      - add a getter for Seats
 *          - and since we had one,that was just looping through the Seat
 *          - update it to return a Collection<Seat> and returns seats
 *
 *      - add a getter for price in the Seat class
 *
 * - Change the code on the constructor where we're creating Theatre constructor
 *      - charge a different price based on what level
 *          - added a base price of $12 for the seats
 *
 *      - set a price of $12 for seats that are middle in the first 3 rows
 *          - if the seats are near the middle of the first 3 rows, the price increases to $14
 *              - ignore the first and the last 3 seats in the edges
 *              - considered as premium sort of Seat
 *
 *          - seats that are in the back 2 rows and are on the edges of the theatre to cost $7
 *              - charge $7 for the last 2 rows , and seats that are in the edges
 *              - i.e. the first 3 seats on the LHS and the last 3 seats in RHS
 *
 *      - pass the price to the Seat obj instance
