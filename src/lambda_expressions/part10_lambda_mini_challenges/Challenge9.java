/*
 * Challenge #9
 * ............
 *
 * Question : With that in mind, can we use a lambda expression to represent an instance of the java.util.concurrent.Callable interface ?
 *
 * - Hint:
 *      - You'll have to check the documentation
 *      - As a Java developer, you have to be comfortable looking up and reading documentation
 *
 * - The Callable documentation can be found here: "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html"
 *
 * Answer:
 *  - The Callable interface has only 1 method that has to be implemented - the call() method
 *  - So, we can use a lambda for it and the documentation also states that it's a functional interface and can therefore be used
 *    as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.
